The app can be accesed at web domain - https://facerecogniser-front.herokuapp.com/.

Facerecognitionbrain is fully front-end app. It can be used for face detection in an image via URL.
The way it does is through use of Clarifai API. 
It also has Login and Register pages, which are NOT authentication but simply made using "route" state in ReactJS.
Other packages used in this project are Tilt package for logo in home page. Also, the background is made using Particle npm package.

This is a part of a big project I'm working on which will have both server, and database.

Technologies used- ReactJS, JavaScript, CSS, HTML.
